# Example: Multi-Client Comparative Benchmarks
#
# Usage:
#   ansible-playbook collections/ansible_collections/local/main/playbooks/run_benchmarks.yml \
#     -i inventory/hosts.yml \
#     -e @examples/multi-client-comparison.yml
#
# This configuration runs benchmarks across multiple clients for comparison.
# Clients are executed sequentially (not in parallel) for fair comparison.
---

# Compare three popular clients
benchmark_clients:
  - nethermind
  - geth
  - reth

# Use default images from gas-benchmarks/images.yaml
benchmark_images:
  nethermind: "default"
  geth: "default"
  reth: "default"

# Run 5 times for reliable statistical comparison
benchmark_runs: 5

# Filter to precompile tests (faster execution)
# Remove this line to run all tests
benchmark_filter: "precompile"
