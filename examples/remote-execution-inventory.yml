# Example: Remote Execution Inventory
#
# This inventory file enables running benchmarks on a remote server.
#
# Usage:
#   ansible-playbook collections/ansible_collections/local/main/playbooks/run_benchmarks.yml \
#     -i examples/remote-execution-inventory.yml \
#     -e "benchmark_clients=['nethermind']"
#
# Prerequisites on remote host:
#   - SSH access configured (key-based authentication recommended)
#   - Docker installed and running
#   - Python 3.10+ installed
#   - User has docker group membership
